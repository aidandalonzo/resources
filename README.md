## Course Description

Explores the application of scientific computing languages, such as Python, in modeling the physical world and advancing physics. Topics include linear and non-linear systems, eigensystems, ordinary differential equations, boundary value problems, Monte Carlo techniques, and machine learning. Contextualizes topics within natural phenomena, physics models, and physics problems. Emphasizes developing proficiency in computational methods for modeling nature and solving complex physical phenomena.

## Topics

- Linear and non-linear systems
- Eigensystems and matrix methods
- Ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs)
- Boundary value problems
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Parallel computing
- Machine learning applications in physics

## Getting Started

### Installing Python with Anaconda

The recommended way to install Python for this course is through Anaconda, which includes Python and most scientific libraries you'll need.

1. Download Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Install Anaconda following the installer instructions for your operating system
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator or from the command line:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Anaconda includes NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter by default. If you need additional packages later, install them with:
```bash
conda install package-name
```
