    "# Parallel Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have a multi-core CPU, and for tedious tasks I highly recommend you using it. Parallel Processing is a computational method that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should consider parallelizing your program:\n",
    "1. When tasks are independent - that is they can be executed without needing intermediate results or synchronization.\n",
    "2. For CPU-bound workloads - that is when programs spend significant time on computations\n",
    "3. For I/O-bound workloads - that is when tasks need to wait for external resources like file I/O, database queries, or network requests\n",
    "4. When processing large data\n",
    "5. When you have multi-core/cluster resources \n",
    "\n",
    "Is it worth the overhead costs? Good question! When do we know? Suppose we have the following:\n",
    "- $T$ tasks you want to compute that are independent of one another (perhaps the same sort of task with different parameter values)\n",
    "- $N$ CPUs on your computer\n",
    "- $M$ GB of memory\n",
    "- $t$ is the time it takes all tasks to run on one core.\n",
    "- $m$ is the amount of memory taken by each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $Nm < M$, then you can run one task on each of the $N$ cores. This will take $\\frac{t}{N}$ time. (It's all a little more complicated than this for hardware reasons, but let's not worry about that).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask, how many cores does my computer actually have? Well, you can use `os` for that"

    "Borrowed heavily from [Parallel Process reference](https://www.run.ai/guides/deep-learning-for-computer-vision/python-parallel-processing)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of implementing parallel processing in Python: multithreading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming.\n",
    "### Multi-Threading\n",
    "Multi-threading is a form of parallelism that allows programs to execute multiple commands concurrently. In Python, the `threading` module provides method to create and manage threads. Each thread can run a specific function or method, running independently of each other. However, because Python contains the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) multi-threading doesn't always lead to improved performance. The GIL prevents true parallel processing for many tasks. IO-bound tasks are freed from the GIL, allowing IO-heavy programs to benefit."
