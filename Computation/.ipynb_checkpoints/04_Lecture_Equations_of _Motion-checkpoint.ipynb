    "# Equations of motion (2nd order ODEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations of motion describe the behavior of physical systems by relating fundamental quantities such as position, velocity, acceleration, and forces. These equations form the foundation of classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and many other branches of physics. Newton’s Second Law, $\\sum\\vec{F}= m\\vec{a}$, provides a fundamental starting point, leading to differential equations that govern motion under various forces. Whether modeling planetary orbits, oscillating systems, or fluid flow, equations of motion allow physicists to predict and analyze system dynamics. In computational physics, solving these equations numerically enables simulations of complex systems that lack analytical solutions, making them essential for fields ranging from astrophysics to engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the motion of an object is determined by Newton’s\n",
    "equations. In the one-dimensional case, we can define the instantaneous\n",
    "position $y(t)$, velocity $v(t)$ and acceleration $a(t)$ of an object\n",
    "using the language of differential calculus: \n",
    "$$v(t)=\\frac{dy}{dt}$$\n",
    "$$a(t)=\\frac{dv}{dt}$$ \n",
    "where the motion of the particle is defined by:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=\\frac{F(t)}{m} = f(t,y)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical methods, such as the Euler or Runge-Kutta methods, are often more effective when solving systems of first-order differential equations. To convert a second-order differential equation into a system of first-order equations, we introduce an auxiliary variable representing the first derivative. For example, given the equation, $$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = f(t,y,v)$$ we can define a new variable, $v=\\frac{dy}{dt}$, which transforms the original equations into the system,\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt} = v$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dv}{dt} = f(t,y,v)$$\n",
    "This method allows numerical solvers to treat the system as a set of coupled first-order equations, making it compatible with standard integration techniques like Runge-Kutta.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using Euler's method on traditional motion model, we obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "v_{n+1}&=&v_n+f(t,y,v)\\Delta t = v_n+a_n\\Delta t, \\\\\n",
    "y_{n+1}&=&y_n+v_n\\Delta t,\\end{align}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can transform an $n$th-order differential equation into $n$ first-order differential equations. Given an general differential equation, \n",
    "$$\\frac{d^{n}y}{dt^{n}} \\equiv y^{(n)} = f\\left( t, y, y', y'', \\dots, y^{(n-1)} \\right),$$\n",
    "we can introduce a series of new variables to reduce the order of the equation,\n",
    "$$y_1 = y, \\quad y_2 = y', \\quad y_3 = y'', \\quad \\dots, \\quad y_n = y^{(n-1)}$$\n",
    "and write a system of first-order ODEs,\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    y_1' &= y_2, \\\\\n",
    "    y_2' &= y_3, \\\\\n",
    "    &\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "    y_{n-1}' &= y_n, \\\\\n",
    "    y_n' &= F(t, y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "You can then feed arrays into our ODE solving methods to calculate a solution.\n",
